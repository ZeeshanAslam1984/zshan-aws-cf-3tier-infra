Creating a highly professional 3-tier architecture on AWS using CloudFormation is a great approach for scalable and secure deployments. Below is a step-by-step guide, followed by the CloudFormation architecture outline and approach to writing modular and reusable templates. This is a large-scale setup, so I’ll break it into manageable, modular stacks.
